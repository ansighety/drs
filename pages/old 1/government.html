        <p>Despite the existence of a monarchy in the empire, the Government of The Inviolable Holy Empire functions similarly
          to a constitutional monarchy and parliamentary republic which consists of the below 3 branches:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>Executive</li>
          <li>Legislative</li>
          <li>Judiciary</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Executive</h2>
        
        <p>The Executive branch, also known as the Cabinet, executes and enforces the law, and has overall responsibility for
          the governance of the Empire. This branch consists of the following main members that are collectively responsible to
          the Legislative:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Head of State</b>: The Emperor/Empress</li>
          <li><b>Head of Government</b>: The Emperor/Empress Consort</li>
          <li><b>Cabinet</b>: The High Council</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Legislative</h2>
        
        <p>The Legislative branch, also known as the Parliament, holds the authority to make laws for the Empire and may observe
          or steer governing actions, with the authority to amend and control the Empire's finances. They are in charge of
          keeping the Executive's actions in check.</p>
        <p>Legislators, which are the members of the Legislative branch, are typically elected from the Almechting Church every
          10 years, with the Church's High Priest always leading the Legislative. It is also possible for the Executive to
          nominate legislators.</p>
        
        <p>This branch consists of the following main members:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Head of Parliament</b>: The High Priest</li>
          <li><b>Parliament</b>: Legislators</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Judiciary</h2>
        
        <p>The Judiciary branch, also known as the Judicature, is a system of judiciary courts that adjudicates legal
          disputes/disagreements, interprets, defends and applies the laws passed by the Legislative in legal cases. This branch
          operates independently from the Legislative and Executive, and its judges are all apointed by the Head of State with
          advice from the Head of Government.</p>
        
        <p>This branch consists of two tiers of judiciary courts:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><b>Supreme Court</b></li>
          <li><b>State Courts</b></li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The Supreme Court consists of the High Court and the Court of Appeals. The High Court hears crimes that are
          considered serious or severe, and civil cases with claims exceeding $250,000. The Court of Appeals hears all of the
          appeals against any decision made by the High Court.</p>
        
        <p>The State Courts consist of the following smaller judiciary courts:</p>
        
        <ul>
          <li>District Courts</li>
          <li>Magistrate Courts</li>
          <li>Juvenile Courts</li>
          <li>Coroners‚Äô Courts</li>
          <li>Small Claims Tribunals
        </ul>
